# Mintel Senior Data Engineer Interview Skeleton

This is the skeleton project for the second phase of the Mintel senior data engineer interview process, 
This is an empty dbt project that we will fill out over the course of the exercise.

As in pair programming there will be a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one at the keyboard, whilst the navigators are on the side making sugestions, asking and answering questions. 

In this exercise you will take the role of the driver, your interviewers will serve as navigators.

## Basic Requirements

- Ensure Python 3.8 is installed locally on your system (any recent python version is fine, though you will need to update the pipenv file and lock) 

- A recent "pipenv" version is available locally

- You have "make" installed locally

Feel free to make any further changes to your environment so long as you can run dbt correctly

## Basic Setup:

Run `make dbt/debug` in the project root, ensure pipenv installs correctly, dbt debug runs and that no ERRORS are reported

Note that no prior knowledge of dbt is expected or required for this exercise
